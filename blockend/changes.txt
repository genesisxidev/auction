Audit Findings for NFT Auction Contracts




Medium Issues:
Gas Limit Risk in Loops
Functions like resetCurrentAuctions, transferNFTs, and getUpcomingAuctions use unbounded loops.
Fix: Optimize loop logic or batch operations to avoid gas limits.
Impact: Medium — Could cause transaction failures in high-volume scenarios.


Redundant Mappings for Auctions
Both auctions and currentAuctions store overlapping data, increasing risk of inconsistencies.
Fix: Consolidate data into a single mapping.
Impact: Medium — Increases maintenance complexity.


Low Issues:
Minting to address(this)
ownerMint mints NFTs to the contract itself, which could lock tokens if mishandled.
Fix: Ensure these tokens are properly managed or burned post-auction.
Impact: Low — Manageable but needs attention.

Missing Pausable Mechanism
No way to pause the contract in emergencies.
Fix: Add OpenZeppelin’s Pausable module.
Impact: Low — Improves operational flexibility.

Action Items
Add ReentrancyGuard to protect critical functions.
Validate Ether transfers for refunds in bid.
Optimize or batch process loops to prevent gas limit issues.
Consolidate auctions and currentAuctions mappings.
Review ownerMint and ensure tokens minted to the contract are properly handled.
Consider implementing a Pausable mechanism.
